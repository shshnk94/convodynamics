# convodynamics

A tool designed to extract interpretable macro-level features from conversation, based on the methodology described by [Di Stasi et al. (2023)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-16512-001).

# Installation

To install the required dependencies and `convodynamics`, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

# Usage

After installation, you can extract macro features from a conversation file:

```bash
python -m convodynamics.macro_metrics --datapath /path/to/conversations
```

Replace `/path/to/conversations` with your conversation data directory.

## Command-line Arguments

- `--datapath`: Path to the folder containing conversation data (required)

# Features

The package currently supports extraction of the following macro-level conversation features:

- **Speaking Time**: Percentage of total conversation time each speaker talks
- **Turn Length**: Statistical measures of speaking turn durations (median, mean, CV, predictability)
- **Pauses**: Average pause percentages between speaking turns
- **Adaptability**: Cross-speaker behavioral adaptation measures
